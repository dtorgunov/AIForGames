    Create exploration prototype
    
    Need to further refine the "unexplored" chooser, possibly checking whether
    a path to it exists. A few other issues seem to come up, but the most
    likely culprit is that part of the code. Consider a better neighbours
    criteria than just "not rock or unexplored", as well.

    Optimise pathfinding and add testing code
    
    Changed the pathfinding code to be more streamlined and added a simple
    action to find a path to a node in a straight line. Will further refine
    shortly.

    Slim down GridNode
    
    Made GridNode more concise by removing superfluous getters/setters. Made
    relevant changes in LocationLocator, in preparation to debug pathfinding.

    Prototype goToUnexplored() and UnexploredNode()
    
    Buggy version, crashes!
    
    So, certain assignements made the code not load, and an error loading
    System only went away when I downgraded to 3.5. The only things I added
    are Stack<> and IEquitable. Maybe the cause is the latter? Need to
    double-check.
    
    In any case, BUGGY, CRASHES, needs fixing.

    Implement runAway() and engageEnemy()
    
    Implemented 2 of the 3 actions needed for Explorer.
    
    George, wasn't sure what int id was referring to, set it to 0 for now,
    please change as appropriate. Also, I think there are some things that
    could do with abstracting as separate functions for readability, will
    speak to you about it tomorrow.
    
    Also, when you set direction movement, I THINK you had Left and Right the
    wrong way round (see diff for this commit), so I changed it. If, when you
    guys are testing it, it turns out that I was wrong, you will also need to
    make the same change to AI.directionToMove().
    
    Connor, look through your comments, some of them still refer to Snails.

    Implement seenByEnemy()
    
    Added the implementation of the seenByEnemy() method. At the moment it
    looks at the closest enemy only, but perhaps we could iterate through all
    enemies instead? Shouldn't be too hard to do, will probably implement
    tomorrow.

    Add the first couple of predicates
    
    Does not yet account for the "visible by enemy" predicate.
    
    Moreover, the implementations are not exactly efficient, searching through
    the whole local map in the worst case. Consider the impact on running
    time!

    Add an (inefficient) way of converting the map
    
    This converts the currently visible map to a Cell array. Note that the

    the others to develop the rest of the necessary methods.
